Python Strings
--------------

A string in Python is a sequence of characters. It is a derived data type. Strings are immutable. This means that once defined, they cannot be changed. Many Python methods, such as replace() , join() , or split() modify strings. Strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters; a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
